Now lets get to your work for today.

    1. Create a home page for your book shop.
        - Connect bootstrap to your site
        - Include a Nav Bar
        - Include an <h1> tag to show the page's title
        - Add anything else you would like as practice for HTML

    2. Upload your new changes to your git repo w/ the following commands
        - git add .
        - git commit -m "message here"
        - git push origin master

    3. Add a few more things to your HTML page & upload them to git once more.
